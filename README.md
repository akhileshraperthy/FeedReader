FeedReader
==========

created an application that reads XML feeds from a blog and parses these XML data to represent in a list view which holds an article and displays a detailed list view of each article upon a click on a particular article.

This application helped me to understand how to use network connectivity such as wifi and data network. It also
	helped to understand how to handle exceptions
- This application uses XmlPullParser Object to parse the XML content and its related methods such as getAttributes,
  next,getName, equals, getEventType etc.,
- As part of the UI it uses list view with array adopter to display the parsed Xml feeds upon click on any
  of the list view it opens a new "intent" which is a web view.
